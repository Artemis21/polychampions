    <h3>About :</h3>
    <p>Being the second newest team besides JalapeÃ±os, they have had a rough start to their 2 seasons. However, the team has great leadership and team spirit, and is far more relaxed than the Jets. They compete in a friendly environment, helping each other grow with friendly 2v2s and 1v1s. They hope to succeed and hopefully compete for the Season 8 championships, both minor and major. The Dragons are welcome to communicative players who are willing to learn.</p>
