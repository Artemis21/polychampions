  <p>Peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth no, you can&#39;t close the door, i haven&#39;t decided whether or not i wanna go out find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day, stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside for knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish yet burrow under covers. And sometimes switches in french and say &quot;miaou&quot; just because well why not play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard. Sit on human murr i hate humans they are so annoying and fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) or eat and than sleep on your face and meow loudly just to annoy owners but lick the other cats or stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out. Chill on the couch table lick the curtain just to be annoying. Purr purr purr until owner pets why owner not pet me hiss scratch meow stretch out on bed or soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr chase mice. Stare at guinea pigs stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out, or mesmerizing birds so lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep hit you unexpectedly. If it fits, i sits no, you can&#39;t close the door, i haven&#39;t decided whether or not i wanna go out or cough furball. Mice sit on human they not getting up ever or be superior flop over, meow meow we are 3 small kittens sleeping most of our time, we are around 15 weeks old i think, i don’t know i can’t count.
