      <p class="page_content__p">Through the years we've attracted the ever elusive subset of gamers that identify as older and slightly more mature, but everyone is welcome! Our mantra has been the same from the beginning: we like winning, collaboration, and coffee. Once a Jet, always a Jet!</p>

      <h3 class="page_content__header">Team History</h3>
      <p class="page_content__p">The Jets have a long history of excellence, winning a title at both the pro and junior levels. The Jets have been a recurring feature of the league playoffs, winning it all in S2 and making the finals in S1 and S6. The Cropdusters, our beloved junior team, won it all in S6. Through our ups and downs the Jets have always remained consistent in one aspect: team strength. We've held multiple positions in the top ranked ELO players and have had power in both the top of our roster and depth throughout our lineup.

The mantle of leadership has passed from Xarxa to Rickdaheals and now to Merlin401.</p>
