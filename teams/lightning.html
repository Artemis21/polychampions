    <h3>Team History:</h3>
    <p>Created at the start of season 1, Lightning had a rough start. Starlord led the team through the first season, before handing the role to Scott. Scott wasnâ€™t keen on being the leader but there were no other good candidates so he kept it. The team did badly until season 4 when Bakalol, Ben and Chief joined the team from Ronin. Under Bakalol they did much better, finishing no lower than fifth place for the 4 seasons he led them. At the end of season 7, Bakalol stepped down and gave leadership to VikingTheCat, who will hopefully lead Lightning to a glorious future.</p>
