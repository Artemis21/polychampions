    <h3>Team History:</h3>
    <p>One of the first few teams, Sparkies was created before the season 1. Sparkies had a successful first and second season (winning the Playoffs in season 1) before falling badly during season 3. However, Sparkies was rebuilt and rebranded in season 4, and since then theyâ€™ve been better than ever, with many of the top players.

The Pups were created in season 5 as PolyChampions minor league expansion to allow more players to join teams. The junior team started off with a decent rating and continued to do well throughout season 6.
